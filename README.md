# 🚩 Injection Demo! 🐈

An intentionally vulnerable web application written Next.Js and using Postgresql for it's database.

You can spin up the app using the docker compose file, and access it at `localhost:3000`.

Go to `/challenge` to start searching for various types of corn *(did you know there was more than one? I didn't)*. 
If you're clever enough, you may be able to **flag** some search results that shouldn't be there? 😉

## Have fun! 🌽
